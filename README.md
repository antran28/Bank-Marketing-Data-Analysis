Hi there!

My name is An Tran, I study Master of Business Analytics at UTS. I'm intensively learning to code and interested in data analytics, this repository will show some data analysis projects that I have done during my course of study or practicing my coding skills.

During my study, I have learnt, practiced and successfully applied the following skills:
1. Data importing
2. Data cleaning
3. Exploratory data analysis
4. Data waggling 
5. Data visuallization

The programming languages that I use including: SQL, R and Python. In this project I will use R language for my analysis.

The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The goal of this project is to find ways to look for future strategies in order to improve future marketing campaigns for the bank.

Hope this repository will help you to assess my coding skills or will be just fun for you to play with.
