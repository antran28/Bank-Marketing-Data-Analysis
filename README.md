## âœ¨ Result summary

- Potentially similar micro-targeting will increase the overall effectiveness of the entire marketing company.
- Take into account the time of the company (May is the most effective)
- Increase the time of contact with customers (perhaps in a different way formulating the goal of the company). It is possible to use other means of communication.
- Focus on specific categories. The model shows that students and senior citizens respond better to proposal.
- It is imperative to form target groups based on socio-economic categories. Age, income level (not always high), profession can accurately determine the marketing profile of a potential client.

Given these factors, it is recommended to concentrate on those consumer groups that are potentially more promising.The concentration of the bankâ€™s efforts will effectively distribute the companyâ€™s resources to the main factor - the bankâ€™s contact time with the client - it affects most of all on conversion.
